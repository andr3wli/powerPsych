The goal of `powerPsych` is to provide behavioral scientists a package to calculate and understand effect size and power. `powerPsych` is a collection of statistical analysis tools, visualization, and calculator that are useful for research. This package is separated by three main analysis:

1. Effect size
2. Statistical power
3. Sample size 

This package was built for my STAT 545B course at the University of British Columbia. I built this package based [this](https://www.ai-therapy.com) website's calculations. Admittedly, their website is much easier to use but here I offer an alternative for people that prefer typesetting. 

## Installation

`powerPsych` is not on CRAN, you need to install it via [GitHub]():

``` r
devtools::install_github("andr3wli/powerPsych")
```

## Effect size

Effect size is a standardized way to report the strength of an apparent relationship. This part of the package dives into *Cohen's d*. Cohen's d is very popular in psychology. `cohen.d` is a function that exists already that computes the Cohen's d and Hedge's effect size statistic. I offer two new functions to help calculate and interpret this statistic. Cohen's d can be categorized as follows:

| cohen's d | Interpretation  |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 0.2       | A small effect  |
| 0.5       | A medium effect |
| 0.8+      | A large effect  |

* `cohens_d` is a calculator that compares two populations/groups effect size via the two means. `cohens_d` consumes the mean and standard deviation of of two groups and it calculates the statistic and informs the user of the effect size. 

* `cohens_plot` is a visualization tool to help aid the interpretation of Cohen's d value.  

### Here are some examples of `cohens_d`:

```{r example}
# New function!
library(powerPsych)

cohens_d(mean.one = 0, mean.two = 0.35, sd.one = 0.5, sd.two = 0.6, sd = "diff")
cohens_d(0, -0.35, 0.5, sd = "same")

```
### Here are some examples of `cohens_plot`:
```{r}
cohens_plot(mean.one = 0, mean.two = 1, sd.one = 0.5, sd.two = 0.5)
cohens_plot(0, 1, 0.56, 0.5, overlap = F)
```

**Note:** Effect sizes are computed using the methods outlined in the paper ""Olejnik, S. & Algina, J. 2003. Generalized Eta and Omega Squared Statistics: Measures of Effect Size for Some Common Research Designs *Psychological Methods. 8:(4)434-447"*.

## Workflow
Here I will describe the workflow for building this package.

1. I loaded the `devtools` package and created a new package called powerPsych
* `devtools::create_package("powerPsych)`

2. Initialized the package repo
* `use_git()`

3. Created my R script for `cohens_d`
* `use_r("cohens_d")`

4. Used Roxygen2 to create the documents and to export them

5. Created my tests for the function
* `use_testthat()`
* `use_test(cohens_d)`

6. Created a README and rendered the R markdown file to a regualr markdown file
* `use_readme_rmd`
* `build_readme()`

7. created my vignettes and built it
* `use_vignette("cohens_d")`
* `build_vignette()`

## Statistical power

I will build upon this package for the final assignment for STAT 545B. I plan on having a t-test calculator and a F-test calculator.

## Sample size 

I will build upon this package for the final assignment for STAT 545B. I plan on creating a function that can inform researchers the sample size needed so that the experiment has sufficient statistical power.
